# General_Store-Appium-Android
In this Android project I have tested for automating General-Store.apk Appplication is using Appium and TestNG. I have automated test cases including Login, Data-driven Login and Add new customer and generated report with html format. A standard framework is maintained throughout this project. Created Baseclass, config files for common properties and also seperate Page objects for different pages. in pom.xml all of the dependencies has been added. So one can pull and run this project in his local system. Also I have added TestNG.xml file from where Test Cases will be executed evrytime.
